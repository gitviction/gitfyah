# gitfyah

`gitfyah` allows a decentralized organization (like a DAO) to vote on prioritization of a repository's github issues - by using a signaling process currently termed "conviction voting". The goal is to have an ordered list and in a further step assign common pool funds as a bounty to the issue. 

So when a vote reaches its threeshold - a gitcoin issue will be automatically createtd and funds will be sent to the gitcoin system for execution.
